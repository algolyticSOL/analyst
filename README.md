   - Processes trading patterns and market context
   - Generates structured insights and recommendations
   - Validates predictions against historical data
   - Calculates confidence scores and success probabilities

2. **Market Data Service (`src/services/market-data.js`)**
   - Fetches real-time market data
   - Calculates market indicators
   - Provides market context for AI analysis

3. **Transaction Monitor (`src/services/transaction-monitor.js`)**
   - Real-time transaction monitoring
   - Wallet activity tracking
   - Transaction significance detection
   - Event-driven architecture

4. **Wallet Utils (`src/utils/wallet-utils.js`)**
   - Wallet validation and management
   - Token account analysis
   - Transaction parsing and categorization

5. **Decision Engine (`src/blockchain/sub/decisions.js`)**
   - Analyzes wallet behaviors
   - Makes trading recommendations
   - Manages risk assessment

## AI Integration

The platform uses Claude 3 Opus for advanced trading analysis:

```javascript
const analyzer = new AIAnalyzer({
    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
});

// Analyze trading patterns
const analysis = await analyzer.analyzePattern(tradingPattern, marketContext);
```

The AI system provides:
- Trading strategy classification
- Risk assessment
- Token preference analysis
- Success probability calculations
- Recommended actions
- Risk mitigation suggestions
